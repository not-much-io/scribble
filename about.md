title: About

I am a young, enthusiastic software hacker (not cracker!) from Estonia. Problem solving skills, beautiful code, functional programming, Clojure, Python, linux are some of the topics that I get very excited about.

I try to give back to the community by teaching both university and middle school students programming and problem solving skills. The Estonian Information Technology College's Linux User Group (LUG) is also led by me.

My blog is just a place where I write down my insight about topics I've successfully tackled. This is usually insight I wish someone had told me before I approached these topics myself.
